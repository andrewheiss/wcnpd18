# Data to play with

```{r pisa, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
data_frame(Question = c("For me, reading is a waste of time",
                        "I only read if I have to",
                        "Reading is one of my favorite hobbies",
                        "I feel happy if I receive a book as a present"),
           `Strongly disagree` = c(.422, .228, .203, .193),
           Disagree = c(.406, .359, .363, .277),
           `Agree` = c(.11, .305, .319, .402),
           `Strongly agree` = c(.061, .107, .114, .129)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(-Question), funs(percent)) %>% 
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf, justify = "lcccc")
```

## Working with R and ggplot2

*Pro-tip*: Searching for help with R on Google can be tricky because the program is, um, a single letter. Try searching for "rstats" instead. If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats). The R community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also incredibly kind and helpful.

- [**Kieran Healy, *Data Visualization for Social Science: A practical introduction with R and ggplot2***](http://socviz.co/): This is a new, still-in-draft book that provides excellent examples and tutorials about how to create graphics with R and ggplot2.

## R in the wild

A popular (and increasingly standard) way for sharing your analyses and visualizations is to post an annotated explanation of your process somewhere online. RStudio allows you to publish knitted HTML files directly to [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/), but you can also post your output to a blog or other type of website. Reading these kinds of posts is one of the best ways to learn R, since they walk you through each step of the process *and* show the code and output.

Here are some of the best examples I've come across:

- [Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) (with a [follow-up](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-followup/))

## Data

- [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions where people compete to create the fastest, most efficient, most predictive algorithms. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. See, for example, [the European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer), the [Salem Witchcraft Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/salem-witchcraft-dataset) or results from an [Oreo flavors taste test](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/oreo-flavors-tastetest-ratings).
- [**360Giving**](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/): Dozens of British foundations follow a standard file format for sharing grant data and have made that data available online.
- [**US City Open Data Census**](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/): More than 100 US cities have committed to sharing dozens of types of data, including data about crime, budgets, campaign finance, lobbying, transit, and zoning. This site from the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) and [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org//) collects this data and rates cities by how well they're doing.
- **Political science and economics datasets**: There's a wealth of data available for political science- and economics-related topics:
    - [**François Briatte's extensive curated lists**](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/wiki/Data): Includes data from/about intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), public opinion surveys, parliaments and legislatures, wars, human rights, elections, and municipalities.
    - [**Thomas Leeper's list of political science datasets**](https://github.com/leeper/poliscitoys/issues/1): Good short list of useful datasets, divided by type of data (country-level data, survey data, social media data, event data, text data, etc.).
